A theoretical simulation engine inspired by quantum information holography. Includes:

- 🧠 QSV logic (amplitude, phase, probability)
- 🔁 TimeCrystal memory buffer (recursive projection)
- 🌀 Fractal feedback engine (z² + c)
- 🧩 Collapse engine (quantum-style decision logic)

## Installation

```bash
npm install ./qih-core
